# **MKTIME Dynamic eCommerce Website**

## **Portfolio Overview**
The objective of this project is to develop a dynamic eCommerce website named MKTIME using Bootstrap for front-end design, SQL for database management, and PHP for server-side scripting. MKTIME will allow users to register, login, browse products, add items to their cart, and complete the checkout process.

## **Key Features**

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users can create a new account by providing necessary details (e.g., name, email, password).
   - Implement user authentication to allow registered users to securely log in.

2. **Product Catalogue:**
   - Display a range of products on the website categorized by type (e.g., watches).
   - Each product should have a detailed page showing its description, price, and other relevant information.

3. **Shopping Cart:**
   - Allow users to add products to a shopping cart and update quantities or remove items.
   - Display the contents of the cart, including the total price.

4. **Checkout Process:**
   - Enable users to proceed to checkout from the shopping cart.

5. **Database Integration (SQL):**
   - Use SQL to design and manage the database for storing user accounts, product details, cart items, and orders.
   - Implement SQL queries to retrieve and update data as required by the website's functionalities.

6. **Responsive Design with Bootstrap:**
   - Ensure the website is responsive and mobile-friendly using Bootstrap framework for front-end development.
   - Design a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for seamless navigation and interaction.

## Additional Features

- **Admin Product Management:**
   - As an extra feature, I have implemented a CRUD system within the "admin" folder for administrators to manage product listings.
   - Admins can create, read, update, and delete product listings through a user-friendly interface.


## **Technologies Used**
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Back-end:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL (using XAMPP and phpMyAdmin)

## **Installation and Setup**
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Import the SQL database schema provided in the `databaseMK` file.
3. Configure the database connection in the PHP files.
4. Start a local server to run the website.

## **Usage**
- Navigate to the website using a web browser.
- Register or log in to an existing account.
- Browse the product catalogue, add items to the shopping cart.
- Proceed to checkout and complete the purchase.
- Access the admin dashboard through the designated URL, navigate to the "Product Management" section, and perform CRUD operations to manage product listings efficiently.

This is the final project I have created at the end of the course CodeSpace - Software Development, Edinburgh College.
It is the product of the main three courses attended: Web Technologies, Testing Technologies and Databases.

My journey into software development began with the Introductory Course, with Edinburgh College, where I was provided with online resources, to create a knowledge base in programming. All the activities, tasks and exercises from this introduction, can be found in the 'www' folder.

After this initial period of online and self-learning, with the aid of many useful websites, such as W3Schools, Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, FirstCodeGirls, SheCodes, MDN Web Docs and numerous Youtube tutorials, I was offered a conditional place in the Software Development course. 

During this course, I learned how to successfully work on the backend side of web development, expanding my possibilities in terms of tools when creating on the web.

This project serves as my 'business card' for my approach to the Tech industry. While I will continue to perfect it and add features, alongside my learning path expanding towards further languages, I am very satisfied with my final result as not even one year ago, I could not even understand the meaning of opening and closing tags.

I finish this course feeling very satisfied with the support and the knowledge transmitted by my teachers and classmates, and with a newfound confidence in my abilities in software development, I am eager to continue creating and experimentig further on my journey into this world.
